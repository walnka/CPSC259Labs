 * Swaps the contents of two integer variables using pointers

 * PARAM:     second_int is a pointer to an int
 * PRE:       both pointers are valid pointers to int
 * POST:      the contents of two integer variables are swapped
 * RETURN:    VOID

/*
 * Now let's try something a little more challenging.
 *
 * Reverses the contents of the string passed to the
 * function.  Does not move the terminating null '\0'
 * character.
 *
 * PARAM:     string is a pointer to an array of char (a string)
 * PRE:       the array of char terminates with a null '\0'
 * POST:      the char array has been reversed
 * RETURN:    VOID

 * Let's see how well you read the lab document.

 * Determines if candidate contains sample, and returns
 * 1 if  it does, and 0 if it does not.
