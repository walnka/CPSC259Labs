 * PRE:       both pointers are valid pointers to int

 * Now let's try something a little more challenging.
 *
 * Reverses the contents of the string passed to the
 * function.  Does not move the terminating null '\0'
 * character.

 * PRE:       the array of char terminates with a null '\0'

 * RETURN:    VOID
